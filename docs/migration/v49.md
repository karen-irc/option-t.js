## Notable Deprecations during the previous major version

### Deprecated `unwrapOrThrowWithEnsureErrorForResult()` & `unwrapOrThrowUnknownDirectlyForResult` ([v48.1.0][v48.1.0])

- `unwrapOrThrowWithEnsureErrorForResult()` exported from
    - `option-t/plain_result`.
    - `option-t/plain_result/unwrap_or_throw_error`.
    - `option-t/plain_result/namespace` as `unwrapOrThrowWithEnsureError()`.
- `unwrapOrThrowUnknownDirectlyForResult()` exported from
    - `option-t/plain_result/unwrap_or_throw_unknown`.

Their operator rethrow directly the `Error` contained in a passed result object. However, by rethrowing, its stack trace information lacks the information about where throws it actually. Instead, we recommend to use `unwrapOrThrowForResult`.
